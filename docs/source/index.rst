About redback-jax
----------------

Redback-JAX provides JAX-based implementations for electromagnetic transient modeling and Bayesian inference, 
focusing on performance and automatic differentiation capabilities. This package is designed to be a 
lightweight alternative to the full redback package, leveraging JAX for fast computation and 
gradient-based inference.

Features
--------

* **JAX-based models**: Fast, differentiable implementations of electromagnetic transient models
* **Bayesian inference**: Integration with modern probabilistic programming libraries
* **Automatic differentiation**: Gradient-based optimization and sampling
* **GPU/TPU support**: Leverage JAX's hardware acceleration capabilities
